## 🛡️ What is Nova?

Nova is a modular, onchain insurance protocol built to secure the decentralized economy.  
It leverages **AI agents**, **Chainlink automation**, and **verifiable off-chain data** to offer:

- 🧠 Customizable AI-crafted insurance policies  
- 🔄 Autopay via onchain agents  
- 🔗 Trustless claim validation with Chainlink Functions  
- 💸 Risk-tiered yield pools for underwriters  
- ⛓️ 100% smart contract-based execution

Whether you're a DeFi user, LP, or protocol, Nova offers a secure fallback when things go wrong.

## 🧰 Use Cases

- ✅ Get covered against **liquidations** (e.g. Aave, Compound)
- ✅ Protect LP positions from **impermanent loss**
- ✅ Secure your wallet from **unauthorized access**
- ✅ Stake into **Risk Pools** to earn yield from policy premiums

## 🧬 How It Works

Nova is structured into two main layers:

### ⚙️ Automation Layer
- An **AI Agent** creates your policy with a custom risk profile.
- Each agent has a wallet with **autopay** enabled.
- **Chainlink Automation** ensures timely premium forwarding.
- Premiums flow into yield-generating **Risk Pools**.

### 🔐 Trust Layer
- When users file claims, **Chainlink Functions** verify them using public APIs like **CoinGecko**, **DeBank**, etc.
- If the claim is valid, **payouts are trustlessly issued onchain** from the appropriate pool.
