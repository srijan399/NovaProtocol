## 💡 Problem

DeFi users face critical risks — wallet hacks, rugpulls, smart contract exploits — yet trustless insurance options are rare, non-intuitive, and not automated.

---

## 🚀 Solution

Aegis solves this by combining:

- 🤖 **Eliza AI Agent**  
  Conversationally guides users to select the right policy  
  Classifies risk into categories like hacks, rugpulls, exploits

- ⛓️ **Chainlink Automation**  
  Handles weekly/monthly premium deductions  
  Automates interest payments to LPs

- 🔍 **AI + On-Chain Claim Verification**  
  - Users file claims with contract/event/date  
  - Our system validates using:
    - Contract history
    - Chainlink Data Feeds (price drops, anomalies)
    - Chainlink Functions (optional logic)
  - Valid claims trigger payouts from the pool

- 📊 **LP Pools + Reputation Layer**  
  - LPs earn yield by funding insurance pools  
  - Honest users build on-chain rep → better returns if they become LPs

- 🌉 **Cross-Chain Expansion**  
  Powered by Chainlink CCIP (future extension)
